# Many Anime Recommendations (MAR)

## Overview
This project uses Python and various libraries to extract page data from profiles on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/amykyst). The harvested data is then used to create personalized recommendations for anime to watch or manga to read. This information is accessible through a work in progress desktop application.

## Installation
As of now, there is no convenient way to install a polished version of this project besides downloading the repository and running it through a terminal.
A desktop application is in development to remedy this.

In its current state, this project requires installation of the following:
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home)
- [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- [Requests](https://3.python-requests.org/)

## Usage

### Command Line
Deprecated.

### Kivy Application
The work in progress Kivy app can be launched from the terminal using Python. Execute `python marapp.py` in a terminal to launch.

## Authors
Created by Oscar Sandford.

## Acknowledgements
The Anime Recommendations project would be impossible without the documentation and technical effort behind [myanimelist.net](https://myanimelist.net/). My work is meant to complement this service and provide more information to users about anime and manga.

In addition to standard Python libraries, this project makes use of [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) for its web scraping and application support, respectively.
